Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are similar to "ordinary" neural networks in the sense that they are made up of
hidden layers consisting neurons with "learnable" parameters. These neurons receive inputs, performs a dot product, and
then follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network expresses the mapping between raw image pixels and class scores.
Conventionally, the Softmax function is the classifier used at the last layer of this network.

There have been studies ([Alalshekmubarak & Smith, 2013](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6544391/); 
[Agarap, 2017](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03082); [Tang, 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0239)) on the usage of a
different classifier than Softmax for neural networks. The aforementioned studies introduce the usage of support vector
machine (SVM) in an artificial neural network architecture. This project is yet another take on the subject, and is
inspired by [[Tang, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0239)].
